# 👋 Hey there, I'm Saivarsha Raju!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Computing, Entrepreneurship and Innovation** at **New York University** where I’m exploring the intersection of **artificial intelligence, innovation, and product development**. I’m deeply passionate about building AI-powered solutions that create real-world impact.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

🔬 **AI Research & Engineering**  
I’ve worked on AI systems ranging from **medical visual question answering using Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, to **speech signal analysis using Dynamic Mode Decomposition**, to **multilingual NLP systems** for low-resource languages.

🌐 **Full Stack Development**  
From backend APIs to interactive frontends using **React** and **Flask**, I build and deploy robust applications and prototypes that help bring AI into real products.

🎯 **Startup Builder Mindset**  
As part of the **Tech Treks community at NYU**, I tutor and mentor a cohort of 20 undergraduates in **AI, web development, and startup tech**, helping them build products and scale ideas into real MVPs.
